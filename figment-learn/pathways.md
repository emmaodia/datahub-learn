## ![](../.gitbook/assets/vhhp1wl4_400x400-1-.jpg) Learn Pathways

Learn Pathways are short curriculums that help developers understand which network is right for them and how to interact with Web 3 protocols at every step. Developers will have to complete a suite of tutorials that will help them set up their first DApp \(decentralized application\) via [**DataHub**](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up), even with little to no expertise with the selected protocol. As they complete the tutorials, developers earn protocol tokens offered by foundations to help align their interests with the network. 

## ![](../.gitbook/assets/avalanche_token_round-300x300.png) Avalanche Pathway

Avalanche is a layer one protocol by Ava Labs that offers high-throughput, fast finality, and unprecedented decentralization. Developers are able to launch their own public or private blockchains \(called subnets\), create and trade digital assets, and build scalable smart contracts and decentralized applications. Learn what makes it unique and build your first project to **earn $5 in AVAX**!

## ![](../.gitbook/assets/4129.png)Polkadot Pathway

Polkadot enables scalability by allowing specialized blockchains to communicate with each other in a secure, trust-free environment. It is built to connect and secure unique blockchains, whether they be public, permissionless networks, private consortium chains, or oracles, and other Web3 technologies. It enables an internet where independent blockchains can exchange information under common security guarantees.

## ![](../.gitbook/assets/logo1.png) Secret Pathway

Secret Network is the first blockchain with privacy-preserving smart contracts. That means applications built on Secret can utilize encrypted data without revealing it to anyone, even the nodes in the network. For the first time, Secret Network allows developers to build powerful, permissionless, privacy-preserving applications - Secret Apps. Learn what makes it unique and build your first project.
