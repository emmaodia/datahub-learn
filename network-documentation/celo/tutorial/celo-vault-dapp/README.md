# Create Vault Smart Contract

In this tutorial, we will create, deploy, and interact with our first Vault Smart Contract on the Celo Ecosystem.

What's a Vault Smart Contract, and the deployment, and interaction thing?

A Vault as defined in this tutorial proofs that your contributed funds are locked through inviolable smart contracts.

First, we create new account and configure essential things to connect to Alfajores.

Second, we will be deploying a Vault Smart Contract to the Alfajores Testnet using DataHub and Truffle.

Third, we will interface with the deployed Vault Smart Contract and demonstrate its functionalities using a frontend with React and Web3.
