## ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/solana.png) What is Solana?

Solana is an open-source project implementing a new, high-performance, permissionless blockchain. The Solana Foundation is based in Geneva, Switzerland and maintains the open-source project. From [Messari's Solana profile](https://messari.io/asset/solana/profile), its goal is to provide a platform that enables developers to create DApps without needing to design around performance bottlenecks. Solana features a new timestamp system called Proof-of-History \(PoH\) that enables automatically ordered transactions. It also uses a Proof of Stake \(PoS\) consensus algorithm to help secure the network. Additional design goals include sub-second settlement times, low transaction costs, and support for all LLVM compatible smart contract languages.
